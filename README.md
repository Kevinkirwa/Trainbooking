üéØ Project Overview
This project is designed to simulate a real-world train booking system. It includes features like station and train management, passenger bookings, dynamic fare adjustments, and cancellation handling.
Project Overview

The Train Booking System is a web-based application that allows users to book train tickets, manage bookings, and earn loyalty points. The system includes the following key components:

Home Page: Accessible to everyone, providing information about train services.

User Dashboard: For registered users to manage bookings and view loyalty points.

Admin Dashboard: For administrators to manage stations, trains, and users.

The project is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with distinct roles for users and administrators.

The database structure is highly normalized to ensure scalability and efficiency, making it suitable for future integration with web and mobile applications.

sql
Copy code

SELECT 
    t.train_name, 
    t.capacity - COUNT(b.booking_id) AS available_seats
FROM Trains t
LEFT JOIN Bookings b ON t.train_id = b.train_id
GROUP BY t.train_id;
